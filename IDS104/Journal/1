How will you apply growth mindset to future challenges?
During my most recent job search, I spent several months trying to find a position in the computer science field. After months of unsuccessful applications, I adjusted my expectations and accepted a job in overnight stocking.
Initially, I approached this with a fixed mindset because I was sticking to very specific criteria despite receiving rejections and no replies. I showed signs of shifting toward a growth mindset in two ways: first, by earning a cybersecurity certificate to improve my resume, and second, by expanding my search to any local job that would work for the time being.
With a fixed mindset, I approached the problem with only one solution and persisted even when it proved ineffective. Once I adopted a growth mindset, I was able to make progress—even if it wasn’t the exact result I originally wanted. Ultimately, a growth mindset is not just about growing to meet a challenge; it is also about accepting when you need to adjust your goals so that you can continue to grow toward them later.
