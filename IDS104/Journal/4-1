Overview
In both personal development and professional settings, feedback plays a crucial role in shaping how we perceive ourselves and how we grow. When used effectively, feedback can strengthen a growth mindset, which is the belief that abilities can be developed through perseverance and practice. However, poorly delivered or misunderstood feedback can hinder that same growth. This activity will help you sharpen your ability to distinguish between feedback that promotes learning and feedback that discourages it, providing you with a deeper understanding of how feedback mechanisms operate in real-world settings.

Scenario
You’re in your first semester of college and enrolled in an introductory course focused on digital communication and teamwork. As part of a group assignment, you’ve been assigned the role of "Data Communicator" for your team project, where each week a different student shares a summary of the team’s progress and insights using simple charts or graphs. This week, it was your turn to create and post a visual update in your group’s shared digital communication channel (#team-updates) by Friday. Shortly after you share your report, you receive two pieces of feedback:

Professor’s Feedback:
“This isn’t quite what I was looking for. The charts are confusing and don’t clearly show the trends we discussed in class. We’ve gone over how to choose the right type of graph for the story you're trying to tell—please take a closer look at the guidelines and aim for more clarity in your next post.”
Peer Feedback:
“Hey! Thanks for putting this together. I think it’s really helpful to see the data visualized. I hear what the professor is saying, but I think I have a better solution. Line graphs might work better than bar charts for showing how things change from week to week. Happy to show you how I did mine last week if that helps!”
Directions
In this journal assignment, you'll analyze the scenario above involving the two contrasting pieces of feedback delivered via a digital communication platform.

Specifically, you must address the following rubric criteria:

Discuss how you might react to the type and tone of each feedback message. Include the following:
What do you notice about the tone of each person’s feedback?
How do you think you might respond if you were given this type of feedback?
Explain which feedback inspires a growth mindset and why.
Explain which feedback might reinforce a fixed mindset and why.
Develop a practical strategy for maintaining a growth mindset when engaging with feedback. Consider the following:
You may include communication tips, emotional regulation tactics, or feedback-seeking behavior.
Reflect on a time you received feedback. This can be any type of feedback and is not limited to feedback you’ve received in school. Include the following:
What made the feedback effective or ineffective?

Professor: the feedback feels very direct the tone feels negative with ethe “we’ve gone over” it feels like a you should already know this criticism 

Peer: the one feels more supportive and positive with the “very helpful” and with specific advice and offer to show personally how to do it 

Professor: my first thought would be defensive and frustrated since I would have already been looking at those so I would respond with reading the guidelines again and seeing what I missed 

Peer: I would just change the graph to line graph quick I would not take up the offer for personal help would just double check the standards to make sure the line graph works 

Either can be taken as a growth mindset as that is based on the receiver of criticism between the two professor challenges you to investigate the lessons to find the solution yourself while the peer offers to show you a path that you can learn from 

Either can be taken as a fixed mindset the professor offers no new directions that wouldn’t have already been covered in class or lesson this could be taken as having just being wrong as you already failed to understand them not leading to growth as for the peer advice it can be taken as you did fine and don't need to learn anything to fix it just need to copy the peers work to pass the professors standard without learning why that is the case 

Pausing so that your first emotional reaction is not what you take away but rather you can dissect what is being said and what can be used from what is being said 

Work feedback I have received was when sorting through what to look for when culling peppers from the displays I was taken from what I was working on  

The feedback was effective because the showed what to look for as signs of the vegetable to cull so practical demonstrations helped with knowing what to look for
