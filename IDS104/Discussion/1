Question:
In today's connected world, digital literacy is more than just knowing how to use technology—it's about understanding how your digital presence impacts your relationships and reputation. In this discussion, you'll explore what digital literacy means to you, 
reflect on your current digital habits, and identify how your digital skills support your connections with others. This topic is vital for your educational and professional success, as the ability to manage your digital identity and communicate effectively 
online is foundational in nearly every field. 

Discussing challenges that face our world often means investigating opinions and ideas different from your own. Remember to remain thoughtful and respectful toward your peers and instructor in your initial and response discussion posts.

First, introduce yourself to the class. Include your major and anything you would like to share about yourself. Then address the following in your initial post: 
1 Introduce yourself by sharing one platform or digital space where you spend time and why it's meaningful to you.
2 2aIn your own words, how do you define digital literacy? 2bUsing the platform or digital space you have shared as an example, 2cdescribe one specific way you use digital literacy to build or maintain a relationship online. 
3 How does this reflect your personal communication style or values?

Next, welcome your peers to the class and respond to at least two peers. In your responses, consider the following questions to guide your responses:
Compare your peer’s definition of digital literacy with your own. What’s one aspect of their perspective that expanded or challenged your view?
Reflect on the online relationship your peer described. What’s one additional digital skill or strategy they could use to strengthen that relationship? Why?
Consider asking a clarifying or follow-up question to help continue the discussion about their digital platform or habits.
Brightspace allows the addition of video notes in discussion posts. You may use the Video Note tool to complete this assignment. Written posts are equally acceptable. 
If you use Video Note, your video should be 2-5 minutes long. If you need assistance using Video Note, please refer to the resources in the Start Here module.

Hi i am Caleb i am looking to earn a computer science degree while attending here 
For my primary social media site that i interact with others on I spend time on discord me and a group of friends have a group on discord primarily to schedule and organize dnd games as well as general chatting its nice to have a easy way to reach them and to be part of group chats 
I define digitial literacy as having the skills to parse through the information that can come from digital sources and naviagte through digital spaces effectivly a example from discord is being able to find and join new discord groups and telling what kind and the quality of information they are sharing such as how funny the groups memes are 
one way i have used digital litercy to help maintain online relationships is just the direct way sending messages through discord in order to reach out and organize games or any other events we plan on having
My personal communciton style is to stay quite on social media and not post unless i know the person and need to send a message to them so discord that limits the group to just people i know reflects that well very enough

Hi everyone, I’m Caleb. I’m here to earn my degree in Computer Science! My primary social media site is Discord. A group of my friends and I have a server there where we organize our D&D games and just hang out. It’s a great, easy way to stay connected.
To me, digital literacy means being able to navigate digital spaces and filter through the information you find there. For example, on Discord, it means knowing how to find the right groups and telling what the "vibe" or quality of a server is based on what they post (like their memes!).
Digital literacy helps me maintain my online friendships because it gives me the tools to coordinate our schedules and plan events. My personal communication style is pretty quiet; I don’t usually post unless I’m messaging someone I know. Discord fits me perfectly because it lets me stick to smaller groups of friends.
