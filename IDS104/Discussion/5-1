Every decision we make—big or small—is shaped by the information we trust and the values we hold. In this discussion, you'll examine a real-world decision through the lens of information literacy and value systems. 
By reflecting on your own decision making or observing others’ choices, you’ll practice identifying where facts, beliefs, and personal priorities intersect. This kind of reflection not only helps clarify your own approach to 
making decisions, but also deepens your understanding of how others reason and evaluate information, a critical skill in college and life.

Address the following in your initial post:

Think about a recent decision (your own or someone else's). What information was used to make that decision, and information literacy strategies did you use to determine if it was credible or relevant?
What personal, cultural, or societal values were at play in that decision? How did these values influence the outcome?
