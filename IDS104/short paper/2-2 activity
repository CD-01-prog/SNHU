Briefly describe each community. Include the following:
Each community’s purpose
Each community’s typical members
How you would participate in each community
Digital Community:
[A. The purpose is to allow professionals to stay up to date on information and events relevant to their line of work, as well as to facilitate networking with others in the same field to help with career advancement.
B. The typical members are people who share a specific profession or industry.
C. One way to participate would be to join a LinkedIn or Facebook group, as well as attend professional conferences that may be held in person.]
In-Person Community:
[A. The purpose is to allow nearby players to find others who are playing the same game so that they can meet up for matches.
B. Typical members are people who enjoy playing tabletop wargames.
C. A way to participate would be to visit local game stores and attend organized game days.]
Identify at least one cultural factor that shapes how people engage in each community.
Digital Community: [The cultural value placed on professional success affects how willing people are to engage in a group centered around their career.]
In-Person Community: [The cultural value of "playing to win" versus "playing for fun" impacts the environment. This determines if the group is a friendly place to hang out or a highly competitive area where participants try to dominate the games.]
Explain how members of the community interact with each other. Include the following:
What types of communication strategies does each community use?
Does this communication strategy help or hinder connections between community members?
Digital Community:
[Members of a professional group communicate through public posts to a board or via direct messages for one-on-one networking. A necessary communication strategy for this group is ensuring that messages are clear and professional, as they are viewed by many people who may interpret them differently. This strategy helps build connections because it encourages members to consider the perspectives of others, which fosters empathy and professional rapport.]
In-Person Community: [Members of the gaming group meet face-to-face around their gaming setups. A primary communication strategy used is active listening. Because they are playing a game with complex rules, they must actively listen to their competitors to follow the action and ensure fair play. This strategy helps build connections because members must pay close attention to one another during their shared time.]
Discuss what contributes to a strong sense of connection or belonging for each community.
Digital Community: [A sense of connection in a professional group is built by sharing common difficulties regarding work and by meeting up occasionally for in-person conferences.]
In-Person Community: [A sense of connection in the wargaming group is built through the shared activity of playing the game together. Regularly engaging in this hobby helps build a strong bond between members.]
Reflect on how cultural awareness shapes your understanding of community engagement and communication.
[Understanding how cultures differ helps me recognize how diverse groups of fans engage with each other online and how they communicate in different ways.]
