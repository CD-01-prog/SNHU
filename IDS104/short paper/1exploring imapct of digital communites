Overview
Digital communities are everywhere, from social media groups and online learning forums to gaming and hobby-based platforms. These spaces bring people together with shared interests, goals, or experiences,
and often become valuable resources for connection and support. Understanding the dynamics among various digital communities is important not only for academic growth, but also for navigating professional networking 
spaces and personal interest groups.
