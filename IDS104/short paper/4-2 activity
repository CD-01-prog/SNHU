Identify a personal, academic, or professional change you’ve experienced or are currently facing. 

As a reminder, this change will be the foundation for your flexible goals.  

I am currently experiencing a significant academic change as I return to school to pursue my degree. This transition requires me to re-adjust my daily routine and develop new habits to ensure I can successfully balance my education with my other responsibilities. 

 

Outline at least two goals that support the change you have identified. Consider the following as you draft your goals: 

Can this goal change based on new information or experiences? 

Does this goal encourage trying or improving rather than achieving a specific result? 

Is it written using process-focused, growth-oriented language? 

Will I revisit this goal and potentially revise it? 

Does it reflect something real that I am experiencing? 

Developing a consistent weekly study process: My goal is to dedicate specific blocks of time to my coursework each week while remaining open to adjusting those blocks based on my workload. 

Maintaining regular accountability check-ins: I aim to report my progress to a partner or peer to stay on track, focusing on the process of learning rather than just the final grades. 

 

 

Describe what makes each goal flexible. Consider the following: 

What tools or habits can help you remain open-minded? 

The first goal is flexible because while the commitment to studying remains the same, the actual schedule can be moved or rearranged depending on my weekly needs. This allows me to be open-minded when I work, as long as the work gets done.  

The second goal is flexible because the "who" and "how" can change; if my current partner is unavailable, I can pivot to a different person or use a different method of reporting, such as a digital tracking app, to maintain my accountability. 

 

 

Discuss one example of an obstacle that might require you to be flexible. Include the following: 

What obstacles can you predict might impact you achieving your goal? 

How would you adjust your goal based on the situation you described? 

An obstacle that can impact these would be more suprise shifts at a second job that could mess with my schedule. 

A predictable obstacle is receiving surprise shifts at my second job, which would directly conflict with my planned study schedule. To adjust, I would need to be flexible by shifting my study hours to my weekend "relaxing time." This allows me to meet my work obligations without abandoning my academic goals, showing that I can adapt my plan to fit changing circumstances. 

 

Reflect on how you might monitor progress on your goals. Include the following: 

What signs might tell you it might be time to pivot your goal? 

What signs might tell you that you have accomplished the goal? 

I will monitor my progress by reviewing my assignment completion and stress levels at the end of each week. A sign that it is time to pivot my goal would be if I notice my grades dropping or if I feel consistently burned out, which would indicate that my current schedule is too rigid. While these are ongoing goals that support my long-term graduation, I will know I have successfully met them in the short term when I can consistently complete my weekly tasks without feeling overwhelmed by my schedule.
